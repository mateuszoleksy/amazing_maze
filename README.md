The game made in 2019 year by myself. The project shows not only versatile use of OOP programming skills, but also production mindset, design, and implemnetation orchestration.

So through the game you are traveling by lighting CUBE and collect crystals. All crystals collected = next level unlocked. Here is example image:
The menu:

The first level looks like this:

The next levels include more darker areas and sometimes a traps...

Also mention that, there are 7 active levels.

Unfortunatelly the project was abaddoned by me due to lack of time. Maybe in the future I will realocate it on 'Workspace vector' once again.
